I'm a software developer. I am familiar with the SOLID principles, OOP, MVC, ORM, API development, relational database design and RESTful conventions.


## Interests &#x1f3ae;

I enjoy solving programming problems in C#. [Here is a repository of some examples](https://github.com/jameslieu/csharp_projects).

I also try to participate in Code War Katas:

###### &#x1f4ac; Programming Communities

I enjoy and participate on some programming communities on Slack, primarily the Makers Alumni channel where graduates from Makers (formally known as Makers Academy) join at the end of the course to discuss various topics, ask career related questions and share experiences working in the industry.

I've try to contribute to [Stack Overflow questions](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2405120/james-lieu) where I can.

And I try to respond to posts on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/jameslieu) when I feel I can help or support other people learning to code.

###### &#x1f4dd; Blogging

I write in this blog from time to time, occasionally about programming related topics. Doing my best to share knowledge or reenforce my own learning by writing blog posts on a topic.
